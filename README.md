### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Benjamin Perrault

I'm a full-stack software engineer with several years of experience currently based in Tulsa, Oklahoma. I've worked primarily with Ruby, JavaScript, and Golang.

Recently, I co-created [Nexus](https://nexus-graphql.github.io/), an open-source tool that generates and deploys an instant GraphQL API from multiple data sources, built with: Node.js Â· GraphQL Mesh Â· Amazon Web Services (AWS) Â· Docker Â· Terraform Â· React Â· Express.js Â· Git & GitHub

Curiosity is my superpower. I'm a relentless question-asker & lifelong learner on a journey to improve myself & the world.
