### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a software engineering student at [Launch School](https://launchschool.com/)

Most of my current public repos are small exercises from the Launch School curriculum with a few from when I was dabbling in Python and Javascript/CSS before starting with Launch School.

You can read more about my software journey [on my blog](www.bperrault.com) << Still not setup yet
